Is there any hidden issues with my DAL?
* in the repositories, need to make sure response.Success = true
* could add more unique messages

How to leave old values when untouched in PUT?

//Issues// 
NW
-MissionsController
*Update, FK conflict (AgencyId) --in body of request or modelMissions
*Delete, 405 Method Not Allowed --fixed with default route

-AliasesController
*Delete, 405 Method Not Allowed

Need to examine the DAL/DAL tests (fixed default api route)


//Previous issues//
NW
-AgentsController
*GetMissions, possible object cycle
*GetMissions, gets all missions without regard to agentId (fixed DAL)
*InsertMissionAlcatraz, FK conflict (AgencyId)
--The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK__Mission__AgencyI__29572725". The conflict occurred in database "TestFieldAgent", table "dbo.Agency", column 'AgencyId'.
	added AgencyId = missionModel.AgencyId

-AliasesController
*Update, FK conflict (AgentId), Changed placement of return response in DAL

//Future Steps//
-AgentsController
*UpdateAgentID, does not leave old values, but does defaults

*Implement JWT tokens for security
	*Be sure to chose the package versions wisely
	*Postman: Authorization tab, Type bearer token, paste string of characters 
	given from the Post Login request
--Installed JWT 6.0.4, Tokens 6.17 at the moment, no warnings received so perhaps compatible
	*Configure for HTTPS?
	*Port values? 35307 and 44350 (443 is for https, 44350 common for production)
